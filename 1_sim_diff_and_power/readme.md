## sim_diff_and_power.py

This script runs a simulation model to evalute under which conditions of migration rates, population sizes, and generations of drift different Fst values are achieved and how easily they are detected using a chi-square test. It can be used as a power analysis, as well as to see under what conditions the empirically observed global Fst can be expected.

The script simulates two populations, connected by some amount of migration. Loci and allele frequencies are parameterized using empirical data, supplied as an input argument (``-a``). Then, a range of parameter values for migration rates, population sizes, and generations of drift are supplied in a parameter file (``-p``), as well as a number of replicate times to run the model with each set of input parameters. 

For each replicate of parameters (migration rate, population size, and generations of drift), it estimates Fst between the two populations, a  chi-squared statistic (across loci), and an associated p-value. To do so, it runs a chi-squared test for each locus and reports the global chi-square statistic and p-value by summing chi-square statitics across loci and using the test with the sum of degrees of freedom. If any locus loses an allele (to drift) in at least one of the two populations, the test will produce a ``NaN``. For this reason, I added some code to remove these ``NaNs`` and calculate the global test statistic and p-value without them. The model output also reports the proportion of loci that produced ``NaNs`` (and thus had dropped chi-squared tests for some loci) so that the user can interpret results in light of this.

#### How to use this file, minmig_pow_sim_NL.py
1. Make sure you're operaing python 3 and have all the necessary modules installed (i.e.,``argparse``, ``numpy``, ``matplotlib``, ``simuPOP``, ``time``, ``datetime``, ``scipy``)
2. Prepare a file of your global allele frequencies (see example file [here](https://github.com/nclowell/side_projects/blob/main/sim_diff_and_power/all_AFs_for_sp.txt)), where each line includes the number of alleles, followed by the frequency of each allele, delimited by white space. Allele frequencies must add to 1 for each locus. For example, the first rows should look something like this below, if you have biallelic loci. 

```
      2    0.935714  0.064286
      2    0.75  0.25
      2    0.819643  0.180357
```

3. Prepare a parameters file (see [example](https://github.com/nclowell/side_projects/blob/main/sim_diff_and_power/params.txt)), in which the values for each row's parameter are listed with white space between, to the left of the hash, like this:

```
### parameter file for sim_diff_and_power.py
10 # number of replicates to run for each set of model parameters
100 500 # population sizes to try, separated by white space
0.001 0.01 # migration rates to try, separated by white space
1 10 # number of generations of drift to try, separated by white space

```



4. Call this script at the command line using:
   ``      python minmig_pow_sim_NL.py -a allele_freq_file -p params_file -o output_name``
   
#### Output

The output of the model is a file called ``*_globFstChi2_results`` (example [here](https://github.com/nclowell/side_projects/blob/main/sim_diff_and_power/test_globFstChi2_results.txt))and it looks like this:

![sim_out](https://github.com/nclowell/side_projects/blob/main/sim_diff_and_power/sim_out.PNG?raw=true)

Then you can use this tidy dataframe to analyze results and make plots! I used this [script](https://github.com/nclowell/side_projects/blob/main/sim_diff_and_power/make_plot.R) to make plots from the simulations I ran for some manuscripts. Here's an example of the figure, where short-term is 10 generations of drift, long-term is 100, and equilibrium is 1000.
