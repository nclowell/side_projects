#### [1] Simulation model for assessing population size and migration rates from empirical data

I built a [simple model]() in [``simuPOP``](http://simupop.sourceforge.net/Main/Documentation) to see what conditions explain empirically observed allele frequencies, and to simultaneously conduct a power analysis. See the model, input files, and examples in [1_sim_diff_and_power](https://github.com/nclowell/side_projects/tree/main/sim_diff_and_power).
